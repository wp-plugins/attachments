Attachments allows you to simply append any number of items from your WordPress Media Library to Posts, Pages, and Custom Post Types

== Description ==

Attachments allows you to simply append any number of items from your WordPress Media Library to Posts, Pages, and Custom Post Types. This plugin *does not* directly interact with your theme, you will need to edit your template files.

= Updated for WordPress 3.5! =

WordPress 3.5 ships with an amazing new Media workflow and Attachments 3.0 makes great use of it. *If you are not running WordPress 3.5, version 1.6.2.1 will be used until you upgrade to WordPress 3.5.*

= Associate Media items with posts =

The idea behind Attachments is to give developers the ability to directly associate Media items with any post. This is accomplished by adding a meta box to post edit screens as determined by the developer. Once Media items have been associated with a post, you're able to retrieve those Attachments and include them directly within your template files using any specific markup you wish.

= Integrate Attachments within your theme with fine grained control =

**Attachments does not automatically integrate itself with your theme.** Since the idea behind Attachments is to allow integration of Media within posts using developer-crafted, unique markup, *it's up to you to integrate with your theme*. The most basic integration includes editing the [appropriate template file](http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Hierarchy) and adding your call(s) to Attachments. For example, if you have set up Attachments to be used with your Posts entries, edit `single.php` to include the following within The Loop:

`<?php $attachments = new Attachments( 'attachments' ); /* pass the instance name */ ?>
<?php if( $attachments->exist() ) : ?>
  <h3>Attachments</h3>
  <p>Total Attachments: <?php echo $attachments->total(); ?></p>
  <ul>
    <?php while( $attachments->get() ) : ?>
      <li>
        ID: <?php echo $attachments->id(); ?><br />
        Type: <?php echo $attachments->type(); ?><br />
        Subtype: <?php echo $attachments->subtype(); ?><br />
        URL: <?php echo $attachments->url(); ?><br />
        Image: <?php echo $attachments->image( 'thumbnail' ); ?><br />
        Source: <?php echo $attachments->src( 'full' ); ?><br />
        Size: <?php echo $attachments->filesize(); ?><br />
        Title Field: <?php echo $attachments->field( 'title' ); ?><br />
        Caption Field: <?php echo $attachments->field( 'caption' ); ?>
      </li>
    <?php endwhile; ?>
  </ul>
<?php endif; ?>`

That snippet will request all of the existing Attachments defined for the current Post within The Loop, and retrieve each itemized property for that Attachment. Using the provided details you're able to integrate the attached Media items in any way you please.

There is a lot more information on [Attachments' GitHub page](https://github.com/jchristopher/attachments). Please contribute!

== Installation ==

1. Download the plugin and extract the files
1. Upload `attachments` to your `~/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Implement Attachments in your theme's `functions.php` or your own plugin (see **Other Notes > Usage**)
1. Update your templates where applicable (see **Other Notes > Usage**)

= Upgrading from version 1.x =

**You will need to update your theme files that use Attachments 3.0**. Version 1.x of Attachments has been *fully deprecated* but is still available. If you would like to continue to use the (no longer supported) 1.x version you may add the following to your wp-config.php:

`define( 'ATTACHMENTS_LEGACY', true ); // force the legacy version of Attachments`

Version 3 is a *major* rewrite. While I've taken precautions in ensuring you won't lose any saved data it is important to back up your databse prior to upgrading in case something goes wrong. This version is a complete rewrite so all legacy data will be left in place, but a migration must take place to match the new data storage model and workflow.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Attachments isn't showing up on my edit screens =

You need to turn on Attachments for your post types. View the Attachments settings under the main Settings menu in the WordPress admin.

= Attachments are not showing up in my theme =

You will need to edit your theme files where applicable. Please reference the **Other Notes > Usage** instructions.

= How do I disable the default Attachments meta box? =

You will need to edit your Attachments configuration. Please reference the **Other Notes > Usage** instructions.

= How do I change the fields for each Attachment? =

You will need to edit your Attachments configuration. Please reference the **Other Notes > Usage** instructions.

= Where are uploads saved? =

Attachments uses WordPress' built in Media library for uploads and storage.

= I lost my Attachments after upgrading! =

***DO NOT update any Post/Page/CPT that should have existing Attachments***, the data *has not been lost*.

If you disabled the default intsance after migrating, used the default values when migrating, and used a snippet from the docs to add a new one, **make sure your instance names match**. The default value during migration uses an instance name of `attachments` while many snippets use `my_attachments`.

Else: please reference the **Installation > Upgrade Notice** details.

== Screenshots ==

1. An Attachments meta box sitting below the content editor
2. Direct integration with WordPress 3.5+ Media
3. Attach multiple files at once
4. Custom fields for each Attachment
5. Drag and drop to sort

== Usage ==

= Disable Settings Screen =

Attachments ships with a `Settings` screen (found under the `Settings` menu in the main WordPress admin navigation) that facilitates data migration from version 1.x and also offers some code snippets. If you would like to **disable the Settings screen** add the following to your theme's `functions.php`:

`define( 'ATTACHMENTS_SETTINGS_SCREEN', false ); // disable the Settings screen`

= Setting Up Instances =

When Attachments is first activated, a default instance is created titled Attachments. It has two fields:

1. Title
1. Caption

**Disable the Default Instance**

If you would like to *disable the default instance* (meta box titled 'Attachments' with a 'Title' and 'Caption' field) add the following to your `wp-config.php`:

`define( 'ATTACHMENTS_DEFAULT_INSTANCE', false );`

**Create Custom Instances**

You may create instances with your own custom fields by using the `attachments_register` action. To create your own instance add the following to your theme's `functions.php` or your own plugin:

`<?php

function my_attachments( $attachments )
{
  $fields         => array(
    array(
      'name'      => 'title',                         // unique field name
      'type'      => 'text',                          // registered field type
      'label'     => __( 'Title', 'attachments' ),    // label to display
      'default'   => 'title',                         // default value upon selection
    ),
    array(
      'name'      => 'caption',                       // unique field name
      'type'      => 'textarea',                      // registered field type
      'label'     => __( 'Caption', 'attachments' ),  // label to display
      'default'   => 'caption',                       // default value upon selection
    ),
  );

  $args = array(

    // title of the meta box (string)
    'label'         => 'My Attachments',

    // all post types to utilize (string|array)
    'post_type'     => array( 'post', 'page' ),

    // meta box position (string) (normal, side or advanced)
    'position'      => 'normal',

    // meta box priority (string) (high, default, low, core)
    'priority'      => 'high',

    // allowed file type(s) (array) (image|video|text|audio|application)
    'filetype'      => null,  // no filetype limit

    // include a note within the meta box (string)
    'note'          => 'Attach files here!',

    // text for 'Attach' button in meta box (string)
    'button_text'   => __( 'Attach Files', 'attachments' ),

    // text for modal 'Attach' button (string)
    'modal_text'    => __( 'Attach', 'attachments' ),

    // which tab should be the default in the modal (string) (browse|upload)
    'router'        => 'browse',

    // fields array
    'fields'        => $fields,

  );

  $attachments->register( 'my_attachments', $args ); // unique instance name
}

add_action( 'attachments_register', 'my_attachments' );`

**Fields Reference**

At this time there are **four** field types available:

1. `text`
1. `textarea`
1. `select`
1. `wysiwyg`

When declaring fields for your instance, you'll be composing an array of fields, each with an array of parameters that set the various attributes of each field. Here is a full example of all available parameters for all available fields:

`<?php
/**
 * Fields for the instance are stored in an array. Each field consists of
 * an array with three required keys: name, type, label
 * and one optional key: meta
 *
 * name    - (string) The field name used. No special characters.
 * type    - (string) The registered field type.
 *                  Fields available: text, textarea, wysiwyg, select
 * label   - (string) The label displayed for the field.
 * default - (string) The default WordPress metadata to use when initially adding the Attachment
 *                  Defaults available: title, caption, alt, description
 * meta    - (array) The field-specific parameters that apply only to that field type
 */

$fields         => array(
  array(
    'name'      => 'title',                             // unique field name
    'type'      => 'text',                              // registered field type
    'label'     => __( 'Title', 'attachments' ),        // label to display
    'default'   => 'title',                             // default value upon selection
  ),
  array(
    'name'      => 'caption',                           // unique field name
    'type'      => 'textarea',                          // registered field type
    'label'     => __( 'Caption', 'attachments' ),      // label to display
    'default'   => 'caption',                           // default value upon selection
  ),
  array(
    'name'      => 'option',                            // unique field name
    'type'      => 'select',                            // registered field type
    'label'     => __( 'Option', 'attachments' ),       // label to display
    'meta'      => array(                               // field-specific meta as defined by field class
                    'allow_null'    => true,            // allow null value? (adds 'empty' <option>)
                    'multiple'      => true,            // multiple <select>?
                    'options'       => array(           // the <option>s to use
                          '1'     => 'Option 1',
                          '2'     => 'Option 2',
                      )
                  ),
  ),
  array(
    'name'      => 'description',                       // unique field name
    'type'      => 'wysiwyg',                           // registered field type
    'label'     => __( 'Description', 'attachments' ),  // label to display
    'default'   => 'description',                       // default value upon selection
  ),
);
?>`

= Pulling Attachments to your Theme =

Once your instances are set up and working, you'll also need to edit your theme's template files to pull the data to the front end. To retrieve the Attachments for the current post, add this within The Loop:

`<?php $attachments = new Attachments( 'attachments' ); /* pass the instance name */ ?>
<?php if( $attachments->exist() ) : ?>
  <h3>Attachments</h3>
  <ul>
    <?php while( $attachment = $attachments->get() ) : ?>
      <li>
        <pre><?php print_r( $attachment ); ?></pre>
      </li>
    <?php endwhile; ?>
  </ul>
<?php endif; ?>`

**Retrieve Attachments Outside The Loop**

If you want to get the Attachments for a post **outside The Loop**, add a second parameter with the post ID when instantiating Attachments:

`<?php
  // retrieve all Attachments for the 'attachments' instance of post 123
  $attachments = new Attachments( 'attachments', 123 );
?>
<?php if( $attachments->exist() ) : ?>
  <h3>Attachments</h3>
  <ul>
    <?php while( $attachment = $attachments->get() ) : ?>
      <li>
        <pre><?php print_r( $attachment ); ?></pre>
      </li>
    <?php endwhile; ?>
  </ul>
<?php endif; ?>`

**Retrieve Attachment Attributes**

You can also retrieve various attributes of the current Attachment using these utility functions:

`<?php $attachments = new Attachments( 'attachments' ); /* pass the instance name */ ?>
<?php if( $attachments->exist() ) : ?>
  <h3>Attachments</h3>
  <p>Total Attachments: <?php echo $attachments->total(); ?></p>
  <ul>
    <?php while( $attachments->get() ) : ?>
      <li>
        ID: <?php echo $attachments->id(); ?><br />
        Type: <?php echo $attachments->type(); ?><br />
        Subtype: <?php echo $attachments->subtype(); ?><br />
        URL: <?php echo $attachments->url(); ?><br />
        Image: <?php echo $attachments->image( 'thumbnail' ); ?><br />
        Source: <?php echo $attachments->src( 'full' ); ?><br />
        Size: <?php echo $attachments->filesize(); ?><br />
        Title Field: <?php echo $attachments->field( 'title' ); ?><br />
        Caption Field: <?php echo $attachments->field( 'caption' ); ?>
      </li>
    <?php endwhile; ?>
  </ul>
<?php endif; ?>`

**Retrieve Single Attachments**

If you don't want to use the above implementation to loop through your Attachments, can also retrieve them explicitly:

`<?php $attachments = new Attachments( 'attachments' ); ?>
<?php if( $attachments->exist() ) : ?>
  <?php $my_index = 0; ?>
  <?php if( $attachment = $attachments->get_single( $my_index ) ) : ?>
    <h3>Attachment at index 0:</h3>
    <pre><?php print_r( $attachment ); ?></pre>
    <ul>
      <li>
        ID: <?php echo $attachments->id( $my_index ); ?><br />
        Type: <?php echo $attachments->type( $my_index ); ?><br />
        Subtype: <?php echo $attachments->subtype( $my_index ); ?><br />
        URL: <?php echo $attachments->url( $my_index ); ?><br />
        Image: <?php echo $attachments->image( 'thumbnail', $my_index ); ?><br />
        Source: <?php echo $attachments->src( 'full', $my_index ); ?><br />
        Size: <?php echo $attachments->filesize( $my_index ); ?><br />
        Title Field: <?php echo $attachments->field( 'title', $my_index ); ?><br />
        Caption Field: Name: <?php echo $attachments->field( 'caption', $my_index ); ?>
      </li>
    </ul>
  <?php endif; ?>
<?php endif; ?>`

= Search =

Attachments provides a method of searching it's own data using a number of attributes. This faciliates a search to be as widespread or as specific as you'd like.

`<?php
  $attachments = new Attachments();

  $search_args = array(
      'instance'      => 'attachments',       // search all instances
      'fields'        => array( 'caption' ),  // search the 'caption' field only
    );

  $attachments->search( 'lorem ipsum', $search_args );  // search for 'lorem ipsum'

  if( $attachments->exist() ) : ?>
    <h3>Attachments</h3>
    <ul>
      <?php while( $attachments->get() ) : ?>
        <li>
          Attachment ID: <?php echo $attachments->id(); ?><br />
          Post ID: <?php echo $attachments->post_id(); ?><br />
          Title Field: <?php echo $attachments->field( 'title' ); ?><br />
          Caption Field: <?php echo $attachments->field( 'caption' ); ?>
        </li>
      <?php endwhile; ?>
    </ul>
  <?php endif;
?>`

The full list of available search arguments (and their defaults) is as follows:

`<?php
  $defaults = array(
      'attachment_id' => null,            // (int) not searching for a single attachment ID
      'instance'      => 'attachments',   // (string) the instance you want to search
      'post_type'     => null,            // (string) search 'any' post type
      'post_id'       => null,            // (int) searching all posts
      'post_status'   => 'publish',       // (string) search only published posts
      'fields'        => null,            // (string|array) search all fields
  );
?>`

Once you've performed your search, you can loop through the returned Attachments as you normally would.
