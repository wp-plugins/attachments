## Description

Attachments allows you to simply append any number of items from your WordPress Media Library to Posts, Pages, and Custom Post Types. This plugin *does not* directly interact with your theme, you will need to edit your template files.

### Updated for WordPress 3.5!

WordPress 3.5 ships with an amazing new Media workflow and Attachments 3.0 makes great use of it. *If you are not running WordPress 3.5, version 1.6.2.1 will be used until you upgrade to WordPress 3.5.*

### Associate Media items with posts

The idea behind Attachments is to give developers the ability to directly associate Media items with any post. This is accomplished by adding a meta box to post edit screens as determined by the developer. Once Media items have been associated with a post, you're able to retrieve those Attachments and include them directly within your template files using any specific markup you wish.

### Integrate Attachments within your theme with fine grained control

**Attachments does not automatically integrate itself with your theme.** Since the idea behind Attachments is to allow integration of Media within posts using developer-crafted, unique markup, *it's up to you to integrate with your theme*. The most basic integration includes editing the [appropriate template file](http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Hierarchy) and adding your call(s) to Attachments. For example, if you have set up Attachments to be used with your Posts entries, edit `single.php` to include the following within The Loop:

```php
<?php $attachments = new Attachments( 'attachments' ); /* pass the instance name */ ?>
<?php if( $attachments->exist() ) : ?>
  <h3>Attachments</h3>
  <ul>
    <?php while( $attachments->get() ) : ?>
      <li>
        ID: <?php echo $attachments->id(); ?><br />
        Type: <?php echo $attachments->type(); ?><br />
        Subtype: <?php echo $attachments->subtype(); ?><br />
        URL: <?php echo $attachments->url(); ?><br />
        Image: <?php echo $attachments->image( 'thumbnail' ); ?><br />
        Source: <?php echo $attachments->src( 'full' ); ?><br />
        Size: <?php echo $attachments->filesize(); ?><br />
        Title Field: <?php echo $attachments->field( 'title' ); ?><br />
        Caption Field: <?php echo $attachments->field( 'caption' ); ?>
      </li>
    <?php endwhile; ?>
  </ul>
<?php endif; ?>
```

That snippet will request all of the existing Attachments defined for the current Post within The Loop, and retrieve each itemized property for that Attachment. Using the provided details you're able to integrate the attached Media items in any way you please.

## Installation

1. Download the plugin and extract the files
1. Upload `attachments` to your `~/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Implement Attachments in your theme's `functions.php` or your own plugin (see **[Usage](#usage)**)
1. Update your templates where applicable (see **[Usage](#usage)**)

## Upgrade Notice

#### 3.0
**You will need to update your theme files that use Attachments 3.0**. Version 1.x of Attachments has been *fully deprecated* but is still available. If you would like to continue to use the (no longer supported) 1.x version you may add the following to your `wp-config.php`:

```php
define( 'ATTACHMENTS_LEGACY', true ); // force the legacy version of Attachments
```

Version 3 is a **major** rewrite. While I've taken precautions in ensuring you won't lose any saved data it is important to back up your databse prior to upgrading in case something goes wrong. This version is a complete rewrite so all legacy data will be left in place, but a migration must take place to match the new data storage model and workflow.

## Usage

When Attachments is first activated, a default instance is created titled Attachments. It has two fields:

1. Title
1. Caption

If you would like to *disable the default instance* (meta box titled 'Attachments' with a 'Title' and 'Caption' field) add the following to your `wp-config.php`:

```php
define( 'ATTACHMENTS_DEFAULT_INSTANCE', false );
```

You may create instances with your own custom fields by using the `attachments_register` action. To create your own instance add the following to your theme's `functions.php` or your own plugin:

```php
<?php

function my_attachments( $attachments )
{
  $args = array(

    // title of the meta box (string)
    'label'         => 'My Attachments',

    // all post types to utilize (string|array)
    'post_type'     => array( 'post', 'page' ),

    // allowed file type(s) (array) (image|video|text|audio|application)
    'filetype'      => null,  // no filetype limit

    // include a note within the meta box (string)
    'note'          => 'Attach files here!',

    // text for 'Attach' button (string)
    'button_text'   => __( 'Attach Files', 'attachments' ),

    // text for modal 'Attach' button (string)
    'modal_text'    => __( 'Attach', 'attachments' ),

    // fields for this instance (array)
    'fields'        => array(
      array(
        'name'  => 'title',                          // unique field name
        'type'  => 'text',                           // registered field type (field available in 3.0: text)
        'label' => __( 'Title', 'attachments' ),     // label to display
      ),
      array(
        'name'  => 'caption',                        // unique field name
        'type'  => 'text',                           // registered field type (field available in 3.0: text)
        'label' => __( 'Caption', 'attachments' ),   // label to display
      ),
      array(
        'name'  => 'copyright',                      // unique field name
        'type'  => 'text',                           // registered field type (field available in 3.0: text)
        'label' => __( 'Copyright', 'attachments' ), // label to display
      ),
    ),

  );

  $attachments->register( 'my_attachments', $args ); // unique instance name
}

add_action( 'attachments_register', 'my_attachments' );
```

Once your instances are set up and working, you'll also need to edit your theme's template files to pull the data to the front end. To retrieve the Attachments for the current post, add this within The Loop:

```php
<?php $attachments = new Attachments( 'attachments' ); /* pass the instance name */ ?>
<?php if( $attachments->exist() ) : ?>
  <h3>Attachments</h3>
  <ul>
    <?php while( $attachment = $attachments->get() ) : ?>
      <li>
        <pre><?php print_r( $attachment ); ?></pre>
      </li>
    <?php endwhile; ?>
  </ul>
<?php endif; ?>
```

If you want to get the Attachments for a post **outside The Loop**, add a second parameter with the post ID when instantiating Attachments:

```php
<?php
  // retrieve all Attachments for the 'attachments' instance of post 123
  $attachments = new Attachments( 'attachments', 123 );
?>
<?php if( $attachments->exist() ) : ?>
  <h3>Attachments</h3>
  <ul>
    <?php while( $attachment = $attachments->get() ) : ?>
      <li>
        <pre><?php print_r( $attachment ); ?></pre>
      </li>
    <?php endwhile; ?>
  </ul>
<?php endif; ?>
```

You can also retrieve various attributes of the current Attachment directly using these utility functions:

```php
<?php $attachments = new Attachments( 'attachments' ); ?>
<?php if( $attachments->exist() ) : ?>
  <h3>Attachments</h3>
  <ul>
    <?php while( $attachments->get() ) : ?>
      <li>
        ID: <?php echo $attachments->id(); ?><br />
        Type: <?php echo $attachments->type(); ?><br />
        Subtype: <?php echo $attachments->subtype(); ?><br />
        URL: <?php echo $attachments->url(); ?><br />
        Image: <?php echo $attachments->image( 'thumbnail' ); ?><br />
        Source: <?php echo $attachments->src( 'full' ); ?><br />
        Size: <?php echo $attachments->filesize(); ?><br />
        Title Field: <?php echo $attachments->field( 'title' ); ?><br />
        Caption Field: Name: <?php echo $attachments->field( 'caption' ); ?>
      </li>
    <?php endwhile; ?>
  </ul>
<?php endif; ?>
```
